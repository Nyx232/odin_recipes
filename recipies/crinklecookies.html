    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These <strong><em>Lemon Crinkle Cookies</em></strong> are soft and moist 
        and one of my all time favorite spring and summer desserts. They are bursting with flavor and 
        never disappoint at a good picnic! They are super easy to make and are <em>SO</em> 
    tasty!</p>

    <p>The cookies have a soft and gooy inside but the powdered sugar coats the slight
        shell to the cookie perfectly making these cookies extra special and quite gorgeous too!</p>
